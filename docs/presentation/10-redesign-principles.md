# 📐 Designing Better Boundaries (1/3)

We've seen the problems and the tools. How do we design it **better**?

## Principle Recap (Anchor) ⚓

1.  **Module = Bounded Context:** Reflect business capability, not just technical layering.
2.  **Explicit API / Contracts:** Hide implementation, communicate via stable interfaces or events.
3.  **Strict Data Ownership:** No cross-module JOINs! Each module manages *only* its own tables.
4.  **Low Coupling, High Cohesion:** Modules are independent, internally focused.
5.  **Event-Driven Integration:** Key to breaking the chain of calls
