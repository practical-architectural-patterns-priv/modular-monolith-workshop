# ✨ Exercise: Redesign Lessons Learned (3/3)

Welcome back!

---

## 💡 What Did We Learn? Redesign Insights

* **Asynchronous Communication:** How did events help decouple the flow?
* **Explicit Contracts:** Is it clearer now how modules *should* interact?
* **Data Ownership:** How did you ensure modules don't access each other's data?
* **Shared Kernel:** What ended up there?

**How does the redesigned model address the original monolith "pains"?**

* 🤯 **Cognitive Overload:** Smaller, focused modules are easier to grasp.
* 🔗 **Coupling:** Significantly reduced via events and explicit APIs.
* ⏳ **Dev Cycle:** Module tests become faster and more independent.
* 🤷 **Ownership:** Clearer boundaries = easier team responsibility.

**Key Takeaway:** ✨

> **Intentional boundary design** and choosing the **right communication patterns** are key to a maintainable, evolvable monolith. You don't always need to jump to microservices!
