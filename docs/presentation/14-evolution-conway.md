# üå± Evolution, Organization & CI/CD

## Conway's Law: Architecture Mirrors Communication 

> "Organizations which design systems (...) are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations." - Melvin Conway, 1968

**What does this mean for us?**

* If we have a tangled monolith, we likely have "tangled" teams with unclear responsibilities.
* **Strategy:** Align team structure with module boundaries! üß©

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph System Architecture
        direction LR
        M1[Module A]
        M2[Module B]
        M3[Module C]
    end
    subgraph Team Structure
        direction LR
        T1[Team A\n Owns Module A]
        T2[Team B\n Owns Module B]
        T3[Team C\n Owns Module C]
    end
    M1 <--> T1;
    M2 <--> T2;
    M3 <--> T3;
```

**Benefits:**

* ‚úÖ **Autonomy & Ownership:** Teams are responsible for their modules end-to-end.
* ‚¨áÔ∏è **Reduced Communication Overhead:** Changes in Module A are less likely to require coordination with Team B.
* üöÄ **Faster Delivery:** Independent teams can work in parallel.

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Implications

* **Remember:** A modular monolith is **still ONE deployment unit**. We build and deploy the whole thing together.
* **BUT... The pipeline can be smarter!**
    * We can optimize the testing phase ‚Äì run tests only for modules that **actually changed** (and their direct dependents).
    * Faster feedback for developers! ‚ö°
