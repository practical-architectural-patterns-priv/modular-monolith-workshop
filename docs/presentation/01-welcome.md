# 👋 Welcome!

**Today's Agenda (3h):**

1.  **Context & Experience:** What is our system architecture experience? And what are we struggling with?
2.  **Diagnosis:** Analyzing a "wannabe" modular monolith (hands-on).
3.  **Tooling:** Spring Modulith & ArchUnit in action.
4.  **Design:** Better boundaries & patterns.
5.  **Practice:** HEET Case Study (HSBC).
6.  **Evolution & Wrap-up:** Conway's Law and the path forward.

🎯 **Workshop Goals:**

* Understand the architectural continuum (Monolith → Modular Monolith → Microservices).
* Recognize real-world challenges in monolithic systems.
* Practice module boundary design (code + database!).
* Learn tools for boundary visualization & enforcement (Spring Modulith, ArchUnit).
* See a production example (HEET) and its evolution.
* Connect architecture to organizational structure.
