# 🏁 Wrap-Up & Conclusion

## Looking Back... 👀

How did the topics we covered address those initial pains?

* Modularity (Bounded Contexts) → 🤯 Less Cognitive Load, 🤷 Better Ownership
* Explicit APIs / Events → 🔗 Reduced Coupling
* Tooling (ArchUnit) → 🔗 Enforced Boundaries
* Data Ownership → 🔗 Reduced DB Coupling
* Module Testing → ⏳ Faster Dev Cycle
* HEET Case Study → 🌱 Proven Evolution Path

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

1.  **Boundaries Define Modularity:** Not deployment units, but **intentionally designed and enforced boundaries** (API, Data, Events).
2.  **Automate Enforcement:** Use tools like **ArchUnit** to protect architecture in CI/CD. **Spring Modulith** helps visualize.
3.  **Data is Critical:** **Strict data ownership** and avoiding cross-module `JOIN`s are fundamental. Communicate data via events or APIs.
4.  **Evolution > Revolution:** The Modular Monolith is a great, **evolutionary** architecture. It simplifies starting and **enables** microservice extraction *later*, if there's a **justified** need.
